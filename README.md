# YouTube Data Scraping Application

## Overview
The YouTube Data Scraping Application is a Python-based tool designed to extract valuable data from YouTube. It allows users to scrape details such as video titles, descriptions, view counts, likes, comments, and more, providing insights into video performance and audience engagement.

## Features
- **Video Metadata Extraction:** Fetch details like title, description, views, likes, dislikes, and upload dates.
- **Comments Scraping:** Extract user comments for sentiment analysis or further processing.
- **Channel Data Analysis:** Retrieve information about a YouTube channel, including subscriber count and total videos.
- **Search Query Support:** Perform scraping based on search keywords or specific video URLs.
- **CSV Export:** Save scraped data into a CSV file for easy analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing.
  - `requests` for HTTP requests.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and exporting.
  - `google-api-python-client` for accessing the YouTube Data API (optional).

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

1. Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
2. Required Python libraries. Install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas google-api-python-client
   ```
3. (Optional) YouTube API key for accessing YouTube Data API v3.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-data-scraping
   ```

## Usage
1. **Basic Scraping:**
   - Update the `config.py` or relevant script with the YouTube video URLs or search queries.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
2. **Scraping with API Key:**
   - Add your YouTube API key in `config.py`.
   - Modify the script to use the YouTube Data API.

3. **Output:**
   - Scraped data will be saved as a CSV file in the `output/` directory.

## Example
Scraping data from a video URL:
```bash
python main.py --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for scraping playlists.
- Implement multi-threading for faster data collection.
- Visualize scraped data with charts and graphs.
